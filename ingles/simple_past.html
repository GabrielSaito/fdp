<h1>Simple Past</h1>
	<p>Simple Past, or simply past, is the most commonly used form of past. This verbal tense characterizes actions performed and completed in the past tense. A regular verb to stay in the simple past only needs to be added with -ed, -ied, or d.
	<br/>
	<br/>Yesterday I worked at the mall 
	<br/>
	<br/>Last week my brother studied a lot
	<br/>
	<br/>I loved you at the past! 
	</p>
	
<h1>Regular verbs in simple past</h1>
	
	<p>For most so-called regular verbs, you just need to add “-ed” as in:</p>
	
	
	<br/>Work - worked
	<br/>
	<br/>Walk - walked
	<br/>
	<br/>Wait - waited
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>With regular verbs ending in e, just add the “d”:</p>
	
	<br/>Arrive – arrived
	<br/>
	<br/>Love – loved
	<br/>
	<br/>Live – lived
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Now, with verbs ending in consonant + vowel + consonant, you must double the last consonant and add the “-ed”. Look:</p>
	
	
	<br/>Plan - planned
	<br/>
	<br/>Stop - stopped
	<br/>
	<br/>Prefer - preferred
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>Two other simple but important rules as well: with verbs ending in “y” that have a consonant before, we take “y” and add “-ied”. It looks like this, then:</p>

	<br/>Study - studied
	<br/>
	<br/>Cry - cried
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>And for those verbs that end with "y" but don't have a consonant before, we just add "-ed".</p>
	
	<br/>Play - played
	<br/>
	<br/>Stay - stayed
	<br/>

<h1>Use of auxiliary did: interrogative and negative forms.</h1>

	<p>To conjugate past tenses in the interrogative and negative forms it is necessary to use the auxiliary "did". Therefore, in these cases, the verbs return to their original conjugation, that is, in the infinitive.</p>
	<p>While in interrogative form the auxiliary did is moved to the beginning of the sentence, in negative form it is used right after the negation adverb “not”. Check out some examples below.</p>
