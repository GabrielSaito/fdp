	<h2>Simple Past</h2>
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>Simple Past, or simply past, is the most commonly used form of past. This verbal tense characterizes actions performed and completed in the past tense. A regular verb to stay in the simple past only needs to be added with -ed, -ied, or d.
	
	Yesterday I worked at the mall 
	
	Last week my brother studied a lot
	
	I loved you at the past! 
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Regular verbs in simple past</h3>
	
	<p>For most so-called regular verbs, you just need to add “-ed” as in:
	
	<pre>
	Work - worked
	Walk - walked
	Wait - waited
	</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>With regular verbs ending in e, just add the “d”:</p>
	<pre>
	Arrive – arrived
	Love – loved
	Live – lived
	</pre>

	
	<p>Now, with verbs ending in consonant + vowel + consonant, you must double the last consonant and add the “-ed”. Look:</p>
	<pre>
	Plan - planned
	Stop - stopped
	Prefer - preferred
	</pre>

	
	<p>Two other simple but important rules as well: with verbs ending in “y” that have a consonant before, we take “y” and add “-ied”. It looks like this, then:</p>
	<pre>
	Study - studied
	Cry - cried
	</pre>


	<p>And for those verbs that end with "y" but don't have a consonant before, we just add "-ed".</p>
	<pre>
	Play - played
	Stay - stayed
	</pre>

<h2>Use of auxiliary did: 
interrogative and negative 
forms.</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">To conjugate past tenses in the interrogative and negative forms 
			it is necessary to use the auxiliary <strong>"did"</strong>. 
			Therefore, in these cases, the verbs return 
			to their original conjugation, that is, in the infinitive.
		While in interrogative form the auxiliary did is moved to the 
		beginning of the sentence, in negative form it is used right 
		after the negation adverb <strong>"not"</strong>. Check out some examples below.
		</p>

</pre>


	
<pre>

		<h4>Examples of negative form in simple past</h4>


I didn’t go to the cinema yesterday → He didn’t come to see me last Monday

He played handball. → He did not play handball.

Susan waited in the kitchen. → Susan did not wait in the kitchen.

I made the beds. → I did not make the beds.
